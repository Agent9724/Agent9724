- 👋 Hi, I’m @Agent9724
- 👀 I’m interested in learning about not just programming, but computer science as I'm fascinated on the ins and outs of both software and hardware and how they're intertwined
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C#, I plan on learning c++ in the near future after I feel fluent enough in python
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on with anyone who's willing to partner up with a beginner for some small projects, we can learn together or you can teach me :)
- 📫 How to reach me: Contact me through here or through agent9742@gmail.com, although my email will be changing soon as it's filled with a lot of spam at the moment
